    <p> Hello! I'm Will and I was a student of mechanical engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I've worked with the Robotics team here on campus and served as the Combat team's Vice President, the whole team's treasurer, and as the President of the Robotics club. I work most with the Combat robotics sub-team and I'm designing a 15lb flipper-style robot that will use springs instead of pneumatics to throw other robots through the air because there are a lot of regulations regarding pneumatics at competitions, and a spring mechanism was found to be feasible by our team.</p>
    <p>My work experience includes being hired after graduation by my high school to help refurbish their 3D printers and select new ones for their new engineering workspace that would be completed the following year. They also hired me to help teach their robotics summer program and their CAD and 3D printing summer program. Additionaly, I was hired by AKKA Technologies in 2019 to help Continental test a new LIDAR system that would be implemented in autonomous self driving vehicles. </p>
